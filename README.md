# snake

A reacreation of the classic Nokia Snake game. 

The snake is an array moving around a css grid of squares.
Using the setInterval() method, the snake array 'moves' along the grid depending on the arrow key most recently pressed.
Each index in the snake array is assigned a class name which changes if the index is in the same grid square as a food square.
The speed of the snake increases each time a bit of food is eaten by manipulating the interval time.
